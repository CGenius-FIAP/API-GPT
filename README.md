## <a id="intro"></a>Introduction

  We are proud to announce the 3rd Sprint of the 2023 FIAP + PLUSOFT Challenge. We aimed to deliver precisely what we were asked to: a new chatbot integrated with OpenAI's groundbreaking ChatGPT, trained toward a more focused area.

  Our project was to create a sales assistant capable of answering a wide range of questions, from stock availability to furniture dimensions, power consumption of a GPU, differences between newer and older generations of certain products, and more.

  Eventually, we plan to add features to complete purchases through the chatbot itself . But for now, we are focusing on core aspects of the project, such as cloud availability and code refactoring for improved performance and lower operation costs.

  We've just finished the core essentials of the system, and from now until Sprint 4, we intend to polish and improve the UI/UX for our customers. We will also enhance the training prompts given to GPT, as well as provide secure storage for conversation history and incorporate image displays in the chatbox for further immersion.

  Our main goal is to automate, to a certain extent, the adaptability of the chatbot, making it easier to create prompts so that it can be used in almost all types of businesses.
